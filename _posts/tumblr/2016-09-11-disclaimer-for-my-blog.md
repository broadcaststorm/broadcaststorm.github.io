At some point, I’ll find a theme or another blog site/format to allow this to be a top-level link for constant reference. &nbsp;Until then, here is some important information you need to know about my content!

## TL;DR

This is my blog that contains my opinions, my observations, and the works of my hands (Tim Miller) - not of my employer (past, present, or future) or of any vendor. &nbsp;I do not get compensated for the content in my blog in order to provide any endorsements, or write any specific content, or recommend one product or technology over another.

## Specifics on Content

I write content solely about the technology and trends that interest me. In the case of lab scenarios or troubleshooting, I write that content in the hopes it helps my fellow engineers just as I have been helped by other technology blogs.

Period. &nbsp;

**That being said, you should know how I come about that information.**

As a IT professional, I have access to a wide variety of information from vendors with which I interact. Most of this information is publicly available - e.g. from official websites, publicly available webinars, and conference events. &nbsp;Other information may come from confidential discussions that are covered by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) or embargos - a request by the provider to not talk about the material until a certain, specific date.

Early or privileged access to information (either by NDA or Embargo) is in no way a commitment by me to write about that information nor, when I do write about the subject, is it a commitment to write favorably about that information. I do not accept access to such information from any vendor that is conditioned upon such writing and/or favorable mentions.

Almost exclusively, access to NDA information is for the purpose of intelligently planning and recommending solutions for my employer OR for my personal understanding of technology trends. &nbsp;

For such privileged information, all content will remain confidential until the terms covering that content have expired.

## Specifics on Expenses

From time to time, either through the course of normal employment or through conferences or through special invitation events, vendors and/or third parties will cover my expenses at events where I may hear about their products and technologies. &nbsp;

More often than not, these expenses are simply the meals provided during a presentation (”lunch and learns”, for example). &nbsp;On occasion, my travel expenses to these events are also covered, which may include mileage, airfare and/or hotel.

At some of these events, such as conferences or technology events, there are free items provided as a result of participation in the event. &nbsp;Many times, this is the usual “conference swag” ranging from free t-shirts to backpacks to battery packs.

Additionally, either through the course of normal employment or my special request, a vendor may provide loaner demonstration equipment or free software trials or, in rare cases, a free partially/fully functional product sample. &nbsp;For loaner or demonstration environments or product samples (samples costing less than $50), I may or may not indicate the circumstance for obtaining access to the technology and I do not commit to indicating so for any or every post.

Any content that is the result of a free product sample (costing more that $50), I will indicate on each post the source of the equipment.

**HOWEVER, regardless of expenses or giveaways or equipment/license provided to me, at no time are these requested by me or provided by the vendor with the understanding by the vendor or a commitment by me that I write material about those products or technologies, whether favorably to the vendor or unfavorably to a competitor.**

Again - as I said before - I write content solely about the technology and trends that interest me.&nbsp;

In the case of lab scenarios or troubleshooting, I write that content in the hopes it helps my fellow engineers just as I have been helped by other technology blogs.

**Period**
