Cisco Live US (Las Vegas) has come and gone - quite honestly, this year was a very different experience for me. First, I didn’t know I was going until 2 weeks before the conference - which leads to many challenges I’ll describe below. Second, my wife came to the conference on a social pass for the very first time (to Cisco Live and to Las Vegas). Third, unlike my previous eight Cisco Live events (starting with “Party Like It’s 1989” in 2009), I did not attend as a customer. I was not weighed down with a significant training, certification, and vendor meet-and-greet checklist that had no hopes of getting done in the conference’s 5 days.

## Late but great - learning side of CLUS 2017

In previous years, I have registered as early as 9 months before the conference began. [NetVet](https://www.ciscolive.com/us/activities/overview/#netvets) status secured. Early access to scheduling sessions. I never had to worry about not getting a session I wanted - instead it was the usual multiple week drama in March or April trying to select one of the 5 classes (all of which I absolutely wanted to attend) because each one only had one offering, all of course being at the same day and time.

No - this year was quite the opposite for as any Cisco Live late scheduler knows, it doesn’t take long for the popular sessions to get full and start the seemingly futile “wait list” game. Registering two weeks before the conference translates into playing that game for just about every session. So a different tactic for identifying and attending sessions was in order.

The short, short version (TL;DR even though that tag is sooo 2016) - unlike previous years of shotgun selection of various topics (based on in-flight or near term projects), I opted to have laser focus on two subject areas (VXLAN fabrics and SD-Access, if you’re curious). &nbsp;Since scheduling sessions met with frequent “session is full” road blocks, most everything of interest ended up as a “favorite”. The scheduler calendar view can’t handle that many favorites though - even if there aren’t many actual scheduled sessions.

However, you can get all schedule and favorites together in one view by printout out your schedule. It comes out in agenda format instead of calendar style but it is easily referenced - and is complete with room assignments. From there, the last task: rank the favorites so you know what your priorities are.

## The first casualty of war is the battle plan

So, the plan of attack focused around one aspect of scheduling sessions that is communicated (by Cisco Live) but really isn’t fully appreciated (by attendees): just because you scheduled the session doesn’t guarantee you a seat. Many an attendee has been heard (or tweeted) complaining about not being given access to the session even though the had it scheduled. You see - 5 minutes **BEFORE** &nbsp;the session starts, anyone not scheduled but queued up will be allowed into the session. Once fire code room occupancy is reached, no session for you!

This is where my printout of favorites came into play - by knowing which of my favorite sessions were occurring and in which room it is occurring, I could very easily scout each location ahead of time to get an idea of the room size and interest in the session (queue size).

Now, regarding those complaints of being scheduled but not having a seat: in full disclosure, there were several sessions where the “wait list” line was admitted well before 5 minutes prior - leading to some legitimate grievances. However, for the most part, the 5 minute rule was honored - I know, because I was in many of those lines!

My strategy worked extremely well. With one exception, I got into every session for which I had registered or was marked as first favorite.

## Phenomenal cosmic content, itty bitty little living space

Which brings me to that one exception and an area that the conference must simply do better at - room size selection as a function of the subject matter. I am relatively confident there is no reasonably accurate crystal ball which can properly anticipate subject interest (as a function of subject topic, attendees and other concurrently scheduled sessions) to then properly match the room size.

But - as Lee Corso is fond of saying - not so fast.&nbsp;The one, central (technical) theme at the conference (and arguably the most important) was “The Network. Intuitive” - around which a new platform of switching hardware and Software Defined Access was launched. Not surprisingly, there were sessions that covered multiple aspects of this new message and platform.

And, in an encouraging sign to Cisco leadership, every single session related to the new Catalyst 9K or SDA applied to “X” (wireless, e.g.) was full (from what I heard of the ones I didn’t try) - and understandably so as there should be a large amount of interest in a new launch.

However, the “sold out” nature of those sessions needs a bit more context (such as when a substance or lifestyle behavior doubles your risk of cancer… from 1 in a billion to 2 in a billion). &nbsp;My limited statistics, personal experience noticed that each SDA/Cat9K session for which I was interested was allotted a smaller&nbsp;room size than other topics. &nbsp;As an example, and I’m horrible at head count estimates but, an overview of building VXLAN fabrics (2 yr old topic) was being held a room for 1000 people but was less than 50% attended… while the banner launch material for the new Cat9K and SD-Access were held in rooms for 150-200 people.

And, keep in mind, while the public announcement of the Catalyst 9000 was the week prior to Cisco Live, there were internal and partner launches prior to that. I’m sure&nbsp;the public session catalog couldn’t say anything until the week before but otherwise it could not have been a surprise what the new launch and message at Cisco Live was going to be.

In short, the last minute scheduler take away is this: it worked and worked well for me. &nbsp;Keep in mind there are high demand subjects (like new launches at the conference) that can divert you so just remain flexible - and that’s where&nbsp;many pre-prioritized “favorite” sessions&nbsp;in each time slot help immensely.&nbsp;

## The remains of the day

It was another record setting year for the U.S. edition of Cisco Live - early estimates of 28,000 attendees, use of multiple Vegas venues (for better or worse) to support the expanded content and activities, etc. &nbsp;Despite the frantic run up I had prior to the conference started, I had a much more laid back experience in attending this year - simply because I had a narrow session focus and an open (social) engagement agenda.

Everyone should keep in mind that any conference will have logistical challenges arise. The real measure of a conference hangs on: (during the event) what’s the response and (after the event) were they preventable and how are they prevented next year.

The latter requires awareness (conference surveys and Cisco Live blog reviews) so make your opinion be known! I can honestly tell you that Cisco is survey driven (to a fault sometimes!) and they do listen. Just look at Justin Cohen’s blog about CLUS 2016 meals for further proof - the egg and cheese options this year hit the spot!

As for “live response” during the conference, the conference does a great job making important information known through social media - and for that, we have Kathleen Mudge (@KathleenMudge) and the Social Media team to thank!

For example, when lunch meals ran out on Thursday, many folks left (upset of course) and went to find their own lunch on their dime. Less than 15 minutes from event staff turning people from the lunch hall, the Social Media team was announcing that [lunch vouchers were being issued](https://twitter.com/ciscolive/status/880511957320814594) - a $20 tweet right there.

Not sure when seating for the keynotes was opening up? &nbsp;Tweet the question to @CiscoLive to find out… or, if you follow them (with notifications turned on), they were pro-actively posting that information.

Or, received that awesome #DEVNET solar 8000 mAh charger? &nbsp;[How about a reminder not to pack it in your luggage](https://twitter.com/ciscodevnet/status/880513035747471360)?

Better yet, [unexpected punny banter with the team that just makes you laugh](https://twitter.com/broadcaststorm/status/880221512753532928).

## Wrap up

As I started off saying, this was my ninth straight Cisco Live. I am a Cisco Live champion/evangelist - for technology training for engineers in all stages of their career, to learning about ecosystem products, to #DEVNET, to engaging fellow engineers - whether at meal time, receptions, or in the Social Media Hub lounge.

While I think there are real growing challenges the conference is experiencing, it is worth the effort and the expense to get there. &nbsp;The experience is definitely worth it - even after 9 straight conferences.

## Disclosure

These thoughts, observations, and opinions are mine and mine alone. &nbsp;No one asked me to write them or publish them. &nbsp;As I said, I am passionate about Cisco Live and love personally writing about it to help people enjoy it more fully. &nbsp;If you have trouble believing that, feel free to check out [my previous blog posts about Cisco Live.](/tags/#clus)

That being said, I am now a Cisco employee (Virtual Systems Engineer, Data Center) and am completely unaffiliated with the conference planning and execution. These are my words and not the words of Cisco.
