And, there were the ongoing operational and project handoffs.

Next thing you know - it’s Saturday and Cisco Live is here. &nbsp;You’ve missed out on checking twitter, or listening to podcasts, or reading your favorite blogs.&nbsp;

Admit it - you just got to take a breath and have no idea what to pack or to expect. &nbsp;Here’s a summary of mine and fellow #CiscoChampion tweets, some blogs, and some #CLUS (that’s Cisco Love) pages.

## Trip Packing Tips

1. B[ring a light jacket or heavy shirt for sessions. May be 113F/45C outside but inside below 70F/52C!](https://twitter.com/broadcaststorm/status/750033186462306304)  
2. Y[ou know that dry heat? Two words: chapped lips. &nbsp;Don’t forget your favorite lip balm.](https://twitter.com/broadcaststorm/status/751799192520105984)

2. [(Courtesy @CiscoLive) #CLUS registration opens TOMORROW [Saturday] from 3-7pm. Pick up your badge a day early to beat the lines. Reg. will be open 7am-7pm on Sun. - Some years miss the mark or have technical issues so you want to try to get registered at off time (not 7am!)](https://twitter.com/ciscolive/status/751415552187441152)
