With the onset of pandemics and travel restrictions, a couple changes to
the usual cycles of life collided fortuitously. The in-person events
at which I typical present went virtual, requiring higher quality audio
and video setups to stream my content. In-person hobbies were shut
down indefinitely so I decided to learn the electric guitar. Yes, it was
time to buy some new audio gear...

## Pandemic Happens

Ever since I futzed around with amateur sound board work for a variety
of organizations and events, I have been a HUGE fan of
[Mackie](https://mackie.com). Their gear in my experience is very durable,
very good quality, and their manuals are sprinkled with good bits of humor.
I mean, seriously, they have the "rude solo" LED - "Please forgive its
rudeness, it is only trying to help, and wants to be your friend."

Now, to be sure, I'm not a professional audio engineer and certainly
can't comment on their relative strengths/weaknesses compared to other
audio gear. But, for my needs, I've never been disappointed by Mackie.

## Mackie Element EM-91C Microphone

I didn't really have that many requirements for these "unprecedented
times". The first, primary need was a professional quality microphone
with a large frequency response. By far, the universal recommendation
was the Blue Yeti.  Unfortunately, given the price gouging on Amazon,
it would seem the Blue Yeti was giving toilet paper and hand sanitizer
a run for its money. I never saw it under 2x its list price.

While I still had other USB-based microphone options, I decided to keep
the solution primarily "old school" with XLR and 1/4 TRS cables. There
were [two options](https://mackie.com/products/element-series-microphones)
available:

- the [EM-89D](https://mackie.com/sites/default/files/EM-89D_OM.pdf), which
looks to be a great microphone for stage.
- the [EM-91C](https://mackie.com/sites/default/files/EM-91C_OM.pdf), which
has a nice, large diaphragm condenser to pick up all the character surrounding
the conversation.

Obviously, I went with the EM-91C.

It can have its challenges though. It will definitely pick up lip smacking,
dramatic breathing (also known as "the big fat sigh"), etc. I very much enjoy
this microphone as it can bring the audience "closer" into the performance
but you have to be careful not to get too close!

## Mackie ProFXv3 10 Channel Mixer

On the electric guitar front, I certainly wanted to try to learn something
fairly different from the technical things I do on a daily basis.
At the same time, I didn't want to torture the family with a massive
amplifier blasting my nails on chalkboard newbie efforts across the
house - nor did I want to invest in one. I was leaning toward a nice,
small mixer board and built-in effects as a temporary solution to see how
far this guitar habit would go.

Honestly, I only needed the two channels - one for guitar, one for
microphone - landing me square on the 6-channel mixer as shown here:

I am, though, my own worst consumer at times. For just a bit more money, I can
upgrade to some pretty desirable features:

- Built-in compression on channels 1 and 2
- 3-band equalizer on each channel, as opposed to 2-bands
- Mute buttons for each channel
- 4 additional channels

I certainly wanted to experiment with compression to see if it brought any value
to the quality of the recording. I'd also made extensive uses of 'mute' buttons
in my trade.  Without any high pressure sales, Mackie got a great upsell :)

As an added bonus, the [Mackie ProFX v3](https://mackie.com/products/profxv3-professional-effects-mixers-usb)
mixers also have a 2x4 USB recording interface, allowing for sends/receives
to a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) - also known as your computer. With some
of the free software available, GarageBand from Mac OS X, and the licenses that
came with the Mackie, there's definitely room to expand my capabilities in
post production.

## Mackie MDB-1P DI Box

One nice feature of the Mackie ProFXv3 10-channel mixer is the combination
XLR and 1/4" inputs on channels 1 and 2.  Combined with the High Z input, it
is possible to directly insert the electric guitar. In this way, I was able
to use the GigFX effects engine to get that rock distortion sound (or a decent
enough approximation of it) when I practiced.

There's only one, small, 48V problem... the condenser microphone requires
power to work, typically drawn from the mixer board via 48V "phantom power".
As best I can tell, the electric guitar I have (and quite possibly all of them)
can't handle phantom power.  The struggle then became either using the microphone
for recording with phantom power while ensuring phantom power was off when I
used the guitar.

Or, you can use a Direct Injection (DI) Box - or direct box, for short. These
boxes take the 1/4" "unbalanced" signal from the guitar and converts the signal
to a balanced XLR signal destined for the mixer. The internal direct box
electronics isolate the phantom power in the XLR connection from the 1/4"
connection.  There are a couple direct box variants but all I needed was a
single passive channel model, namely the
[MDB-1P](https://mackie.com/products/mdb-series-direct-boxes).

## Wrapping it all up

Here's the final configuration that I've assembled.  

![Final Studio Setup](/images/mackie_complete_setup.png){: .align-center}

As you can see in the photo, I added an adaptor to take the 1/4" main outputs
and convert them into a 1/8" adapter to plug in some headphones.  I do have to
hear my playing after all.

Additionally, the USB connection from the back of the board is connected to
my Mac Mini.

Stay tuned as there might be a post with samples of the audio in the near future!
