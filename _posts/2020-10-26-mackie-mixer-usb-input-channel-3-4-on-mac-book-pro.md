On the [Mackie ProFXv3 10 channel](https://mackie.com/products/profxv3-professional-effects-mixers-usb)
mixer, you have 2x4 USB I/O available: 2 output channels and 4 input
channels. On a Mac Book Pro, those channels are natively available
without a custom driver. However, finding the input channels 3-4 -
which would appear as outputs on the Mac - is not quite as straightforward as one might think.

## Pandemic Happens

Without telling too long of a story, once the pandemic shut everything
down, a few life changes collide fortuitously:

- the in-person events I give presentations at went virtual and required
higher quality audio and video equipment.
- my normal hobbies weren't possible so I decided to try out learning
the electric guitar.
- my training videos needed a bit more help on the audio to really have
a good quality to them. 

This cosmic alignment resulted in purchasing some quality audio gear from
[Mackie](https://mackie.com).  Ever since doing amateur sound board work
for a variety of events, I have been a HUGE fan of Mackie. Their gear
in my experience is very durable, very good quality, and their manuals
are sprinkled with good bits of humor. To be sure, I'm not a professional
audio engineer and certainly can't comment and their relative strengths
and weaknesses compared to other audio gear. But, for my needs, I've
never been disappointed by Mackie.
