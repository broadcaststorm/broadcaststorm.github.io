I've decided to relocate my blog content to something a little
more developer and automation engineer friendly. Tumblr - the
previous hoster of my content - has quite frankly become a bit
less professional than when I began over 7 years ago. 

Honestly, the content I've been desiring to post has matured over
the years as well, becoming less of a side hobby to document snippets
of learned information.  Now, this contents is something I consider
much more important to do - both for the benefit of the community
which has certainly helped in my growth as well as for myself.

I won't be as contrived to say I have a responsibility to post it
because, frankly, who the heck am I? Having said that, if we all
fail to contribute something to the community, the community doesn't
grow. We all need to constantly strive to follow the conservationist
mantra I learned in the Scouting - "leave a place better than you
found it".

In this context, that imposes upon me the requirement to take direct,
personal action - as opposed to telling all of you to do it - to add
useful information and wisdom to this space.

Hopefully, that's what you find here going forward.  Not sure you'll
find that in the archival posts of this site, ported from Tumblr - 
I was younger and less experienced then. But, the content remains 
anyways and find what nuggets you may there.
