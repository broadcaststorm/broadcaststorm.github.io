## Cisco Live

### "DevNet: Automating Cisco UCS Server Provisioning with Terraform and Intersight‚Äù - Cisco Live 2021: BRKDEV-2004 (45-min breakout)

**Abstract** Automation has been at the heart of Cisco UCS and the Intersight platform since their foundation. Recently, Cisco expanded that ecosystem to include a Terraform provider that consumes Intersight's OpenAPI-based REST interface. This session will walk participants through the Intersight data model, its relation to the Terraform provider resources, and arrive with a complete Terraform configuration that fully configures a physical, UCS C-series server via Intersight. The session will include a demo that showcases the final state of the server. Attendees will have access to the publicly available GitHub repository for these tasks.
