## Cisco Live

### "DevNet: Automating Cisco UCS Server Provisioning with Terraform and Intersight” - Cisco Live 2021: BRKDEV-2004 (45-min breakout)

**Abstract** Automation has been at the heart of Cisco UCS and the Intersight platform since their foundation. Recently, Cisco expanded that ecosystem to include a Terraform provider that consumes Intersight's OpenAPI-based REST interface. This session will walk participants through the Intersight data model, its relation to the Terraform provider resources, and arrive with a complete Terraform configuration that fully configures a physical, UCS C-series server via Intersight. The session will include a demo that showcases the final state of the server. Attendees will have access to the publicly available GitHub repository for these tasks.

### "Demystifying Applicaton Modeling and Workload Management in CloudCenter Suite” - Cisco Live 2020 Digital: DGTL-BRKCLD-2002 (90-min Technical Breakout)

**Abstract** Application profiles are the core technology in Cisco CloudCenter Suite's Workload Manager that enables you to model your application once and deploy it anywhere. In this session, attendees will learn the anatomy of these profiles and how to best leverage them to meet your strategic goals. The session will explore the various stages of a deployment and how those stages - with their settings – map to resource consumption in cloud environments. Integrations and contrasts with various open source tools will be discussed. The session will also cover common operational tasks with application deployments, demonstrating the full lifecycle management of an application using CloudCenter Suite Workload Manager.

### "DevNet Workshop: Leveraging NX-APIs for Customized Operational Analytics” - Cisco Live 2020 Barcelona: DEVWKS-2594 (45-min workshop)

**Abstract** Monitoring tools can't quite give you the operational views you are looking for? One of the untapped potentials of APIs is the ability to gather specific metrics from your networking infrastructure to build customized dashboards for operations. In this session, participants will be presented an overview of interesting metrics that can be collected from NX-API, how to leverage Python to access the API to collect the data, and populate that data in modern visualization platforms (Prometheus and Grafana).

### "A Look at Microsegmentation in VXLAN EVPN” - Cisco Live 2020 Barcelona: DEVLIT-4001 (20-min lightning talk)

**Abstract** Microsegmentation is a key design strategy in securing the data center. Cisco's primary microsegmentation solutions are ACI at the network layer and Tetration at the operating system layer. However, customers are choosing to deploy Nexus 9000 switches in the data center using the VXLAN EVPN based fabric technology. Can we realize equivalent levels of microsegmentation in VXLAN EVPN fabrics that we see with ACI? This lightning talk will dive right into the different flavors of microsegmentation, demonstrating switch configurations and automation on what microsegmentation can be realized in VXLAN EVPN fabrics.

### "DevNet Workshop: Safely using your Nexus 9000 switches as a Kubernetes cluster" - Cisco Live 2019 San Diego: DEVWKS-2096 (45-min workshop)

**Abstract** Do you have containerized sensors or applications at the edge and no place to run them?  Need a container management and orchestration strategy to boot?  With the 9.2 release, NX-OS running on your Nexus 9000 switches now comes with Docker 1.13.1.  With the promise of a standardized container runtime comes the challenge of application deployment and management - including upgrade of applications. In this session, you will enable the Docker container engine on your Nexus 9000 switches and install the kubelet to join the Kubernetes cluster.  Once operational, attendees will deploy an application to targeted switches and upgrade those applications.  The code for these tasks and their automation will be provided to attendees.

### "Cisco UCS as an Advanced Computing Platform for the Enterprise" - Cisco Live 2018 Orlando: TECINI-2543 (4 hour Techinical Seminar)

**Abstract** The explosion of data and bandwidth in the Internet age requires significant amounts of computation and storage to gain insights and intelligence to drive innovation. Parallel computing using clustered x86 system is one technique for advanced research problems. Now these problems are pushing computation and machine learning to new frontiers with supplemental accelerator technology such as GPUs.

The session will cover x86 clustering and storage technology (i.e. Big Data, RoCE and Infiniband, Message Passing Interface (MPI), etc) using the Cisco UCS C240 M5 and S3260 systems.  Participants will learn about GPU-based computing and machine learning as applied to advanced research problems. 
	
This session will include demonstrations of the technologies. The hands-on labs will include building a HPC cluster on a personal laptop using Bright Computing Cluster Manager and will include Machine Learning exercises. Experts from Bright Computing and Nvidia will co-lead the session.
