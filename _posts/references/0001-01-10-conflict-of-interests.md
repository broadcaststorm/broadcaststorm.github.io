# Summary

In short, this site is ***my*** blog, containing ***my*** thoughts,
opinions, and analysis about technology, life, etc. I do not accept
direct, monetary compensation to produce any specific content for
any specific vendor, group, etc.

It goes without saying - but I will say it anyway because I'm legally
required - my thoughts, opinions, analysis, and writings are not the
official (or unofficial) statements or positions of my employer (past,
present, and almost certainly future). In publishing the content I do,
my employer does not endorse, condone, or approve the material on this
blog prior to or after publication.

I write content here for two reasons:

1. Blog content from other professionals across the Internet has helped
me learn, troubleshoot, and improve my understanding of technology. I
would like to contribute what I've learned to help others as well.
2. Coming from an academic background, I've learned that publishing
your understanding of an idea or topic is a fantastic way to organize
those thoughts, clear up any lingering gaps, and provide a great deal
of clarity to what you've learned.  And, when you come back a few years
later, you won't struggle to remember it correctly as you'll have written
it down!

# Disclaimers

With that general disclaimer on potential conflicts of interest, I do
want to provide complete transparency into my circumstances around the
times I publish content.  With that in mind, there are a couple of
specific posts with explicit disclosure for those periods of time.

## Prior to October 2015

During these blogs, I was employed as a network architect at Wake Forest
University.  I was an adjunct professor of Computer Science and Physics.
My role had no requirement (or incentive) to publish content on the
Internet.

## October 2015 to Jan 2017

During these blogs, I was employed as a Linux systems engineer for
High Performance Computing at a high frequency trading company. The
company permitted participation as a delegate for
[Tech Field Day](https://techfieldday.com). For those events, I have
written a [specific disclaimer post](/disclaimer-for-my-blog).

## Jan 2017 to present

Blog content during this time was generated while I was employed at
Cisco Systems, Inc. To date, these roles have been technical, pre-sales
roles (DC TSA). While I was not compensated directly for the content,
nor was content a responsibility of my roles, nor do I speak on behalf
of Cisco Systems, Inc in any form or fashion... I did have access to
a great deal of resources to support those posts (e.g. lab space,
hardware devices, software licenses, etc.). That gear was not provided
as a condition to write the content on this site.
